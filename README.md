# OneUI Port

## WIP

This is a script to port oneui from A515f for M307f, if any changes or stupidness found, please pr :D

Instructions:
extract both firmware, and write its source and destination ( Source being m30s from which we are copying things, and destination here being A515f, which rom we want to boot) 

then just run the script, repack, flash and check

code is documented, so just read through it once and change whatever is needed :)
